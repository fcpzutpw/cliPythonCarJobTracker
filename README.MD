This is just a script to simplified my routine work with some entries from mechanical who just send me dry rows like 
"Made update with... 3500 KZT". 
Too hard to manage this format to know any statistic of expense of your radwan. 

How it works: you need just a start script from your directory by command in CLI: python main.py
In the menu, you need to select what type of action you want to do with your expenses.

Choose action, then enter name, add price, add currency.

After you're done with all actions you may want to know, how much expense your project - just press 4th menu action and
enter what currency you want to total your prices.
